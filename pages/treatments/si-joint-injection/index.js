                    <p>
                      It is the sacroiliac joints (SI) that connect the spine to
                      the pelvis at its base. Inflammation of the SI joint is
                      frequently responsible for lower back pain. As well as
                      groins, buttocks, and legs being affected, it may also
                      result in back pain. These symptoms can occur for a number
                      of reasons, but they are very common. In order to begin an
                      appropriate treatment plan for SI joint dysfunction, it is
                      vital that your doctor confirms that this is the cause of
                      your pain. Generalized pain treatments do not work very
                      well for SI joint dysfunction.<br></br>
                      SI joint dysfunction can be diagnosed and treated by
                      injecting substances into the joints. Consider this
                      treatment option if you suffer from{" "}

                    <p>

                      . The large pelvis bones (ilium) are connected by this
                      joint to the bones in the spine (sacrum). The sacroiliac
                      joints are located on both sides of the body, one on each
                      side.<br></br>
                      These bones connect each side of the pelvis to the sacrum.
                      As shock absorbers, these joints perform this function.
                      During the movement of the legs and the upper body, they
                      transmit weight and forces. A sacroiliac joint disorder
                      may result in pain in the lower back, the buttocks or the
                      hips. If you undergo a sacroiliac joint injection, you may
                      experience pain related to the sacroiliac joint. This
                      procedure can also relieve pain in that area.

                      Doctor will keep an eye on you for about 30 minutes after

                      you have experienced pain relief (and if so, for how
                      long), your current pain score, and if you are having any
                      difficulties. We recommend that you contact the{" "}
                      <Link href="/"> Premier Pain </Link> Centers immediately

                      your legs, a fever of 100.5 or higher, or signs of
                      infection in the area of the injection (redness, swelling,
                      heat, discharge).
