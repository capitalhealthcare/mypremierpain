                      involves implanting electrodes in the body to alter how
                      the nervous system functions. In order to stimulate
                      peripheral nerves and fields in the area of pain,
                      electrodes are put directly on the nerves or under the
                      skin. A small incision is all it takes for this minimally
                      invasive procedure. As opposed to spinal cord stimulation,
                      which is where the nerve originates,&nbsp;

                      stimulates the nerve directly. It is pertinent to note

                    </p>

                    <h2>How Does Peripheral Nerve Stimulation Work?&nbsp;</h2>

                      process consists of two stages, separated by several
                      days.&nbsp;
                    </p>

                    <h2>STAGE 1 (ELECTRODE IMPLANTATION)&nbsp;</h2>

                    <p>
                      Your skin will be cleaned with an antiseptic in the
                      operating room. If you require light general anesthesia,
                      you will receive a local anesthetic and be lightly
                      sedated. It will be necessary to make an incision in order
                      to identify the nerve and prepare it for surgery. The
                      nerve will be surrounded by one or more electrodes (wires)
                      depending on its location. It will be necessary to insert
                      and secure these devices through the skin. In the recovery
                      room, the patient will spend some time after receiving
                      treatment before returning to his or her bedside. A pain
                      monitor attached to an external stimulator will monitor
                      your pain for several days. Throughout the admissions
                      process, you&apos;ll describe and score your pain. It will
                      be possible to determine the effectiveness of the
                      treatment through the use of this procedure. In this
                      manner, you will be able to determine if the level of pain
                      relief you have received is satisfactory.&nbsp;
                    </p>

                    <h2>STAGE 2 (BATTERY INSERTION)&nbsp;</h2>

                    <p>
                      You will be able to undergo the full implantation several
                      days or a week later if you are satisfied with the amount
                      of pain relief you obtained from the trial. The procedure
                      requires a general anesthetic (you will be asleep during
                      the procedure). Extending the temporary wire extensions
                      removes the temporary electrodes and connects them to
                      extension wires connected to battery packs.&nbsp;
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Implanting this battery usually involves placing it in
                      your chest, back, or abdomen Moreover, over the next few
                      days and weeks, your battery will be programmed so you get
                      the best stimulation possible.&nbsp;

                    <p>
                      You will receive detailed instructions from your doctor
                      regarding the use of the device. If you are having an MRI
                      or going through airport security, you may receive
                      additional instructions. It is patient-friendly, according
                      to Dr. Deer. &quot;Patients do not need to wear the
                      external part of the PNS device all the time; they only
                      need to wear it when they are experiencing pain,&quot; he
                      states. Patients are able to remove their external parts
                      to bathe, shower, and swim. Most complications associated
                      with PNS are superficial skin infections, although bleeds
                      and nerve damage are possible occasionally. With new
                      devices, the implants remain in place and there is no
                      movement of the lead wires, which is known as &quot;lead
                      migration.&quot;. It may be necessary to reprogramme the
                      computer on an annual basis. Moreover, if the device does
                      not relieve your pain, it may be removed.
