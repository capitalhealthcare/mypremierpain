                    <h2> Percutaneous Discectomy </h2>
                    <p>
                      Approximately two percent of the U.S. population suffers
                      from back pain (or millions of adults). Herniated discs
                      that press on nerve fibers or the spinal cord may be
                      treated with a lumbar percutaneous discectomy.By removing
                      deviated disc material and disc fragments, lumbar
                      percutaneous discectomy is intended to relieve nerve
                      compression.This minimally invasive procedure involves
                      making an incision between the vertebrae and inserting a
                      tiny surgical needle into the disc middle.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What Is A Discectomy?</h2>
                    <p>
                      Discectomy involves surgically removing parts of a
                      herniated or slipped disc in order to relieve pressure on
                      nerve roots or the spinal cord. Decompressing the spine is
                      necessary to increase flexibility and mobility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      There may be some pain associated with a herniated disc,
                      but this usually subsides once the disc is removed from
                      the spinal cord. Those suffering from chronic pain in
                      their lower backs and legs may benefit from discectomy
                      treatment.{" "}
                    </p>

                      has many advantages. Most patients report rapid relief
                      from pain following this procedure, which is relatively
                      straightforward. In addition to being minimally invasive,
                      this procedure produces virtually no scarring or
                      discomfort.<br></br>
                      Comparatively to other procedures, percutaneous discectomy
                      offers the following advantages:

                    <p>
                      A lumbar percutaneous discectomy is less risky and also
                      allows for a faster recovery time than other forms of
                      spinal surgery.

                      may be an effective treatment option for patients with
                      ongoing back, neck, or sciatica pain, as well as spinal
                      stenosis, which narrows the spinal canal and presses on
                      the spinal cord.<br></br>
                      This procedure may be appropriate for patients who have
                      failed to improve their symptoms after four to six weeks
                      of conservative treatment methods such as exercise,
                      medication, physical therapy, or chiropractic treatment.
                      <br></br>
                      The patient may benefit from a lumbar percutaneous
                      discectomy if his or her symptoms make it difficult for
                      him or her to perform normal daily activities.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How Is A Percutaneous Discectomy (Pd) Performed?</h2>
                    <ul className="bullt-list v1">
                      <li>
                        To minimize pain and stress on the body, patients are
                        administered sedatives and local anesthetics before the
                        procedure.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        After positioning the patient face down, the surgeon
                        ensures that the affected area is easily accessible.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The goal is to insert a large needle into the surgical
                        site after numbing it.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Heat waves are used to reduce the disc size once the
                        needle is inserted, as well as to remove disruptive
                        material from the disc.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Most herniated discs can be relieved by removing disc
                        material, which also reduces the pressure within the
                        spinal column. The patient will be moved to the recovery
                        area for observation as soon as the needle insertion
                        site has been closed.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        PDs are usually performed as outpatient procedures and
                        take about 30 minutes to complete. It is generally
                        possible for patients to return home the same day that
                        they have undergone surgery, within one to three hours
                        of their surgery. In the first 24 to 48 hours following
                        an injection, there may be some discomfort at the
                        injection site.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        It may be necessary to apply heat packs or cold packs to
                        the patient's body in order to relieve this discomfort,
                        as needed and as recommended. Your physician may
                        prescribe pain medication post-PD if it is necessary for
                        you to take it as directed. A patient should also rest
                        for at least 24 hours following surgery in order to
                        ensure that their recovery will be as smooth as
                        possible.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Despite the fact that recovery time varies from case to
                        case, most patients find that after a week or so, they
                        are able to return to their normal daily routines.
                      </li>

                        During the procedure, there is no requirement for
                        general anesthesia; the patient will receive a local
                        anesthetic and may also be under mild sedation. The
                        insertion of the needle is painless.

                        Following the insertion of the needle into the disc,

                        30 minutes, the patient will receive a small bandage
                        covering the needle site.
