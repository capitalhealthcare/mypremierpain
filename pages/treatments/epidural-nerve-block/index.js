                    <p>
                      Epidurals are pain-relieving anesthesias that some
                      pregnant women receive during birth. It is also useful for
                      other purposes. In order to insert the catheter, you need
                      to penetrate the epidural space, which surrounds your
                      spinal cord. The use of epidural injections for pain
                      relief is not limited to managing chronic pain.There may
                      be circumstances in which this is not appropriate<br></br>
                      As a result, it has fewer side effects if it's an option.
                      Getting an epidural can even help you stay alert and
                      mobile for a longer period of time. An epidural is a
                      procedure to deal with pain or numbness during labor,
                      childbirth, surgery, and chronic pain. Epidurals are
                      generally safe, but they can have side effects too.

                      spine during surgery.

                        This medication prevents the brain from receiving
                        signals sent by the spine by blocking their
                        transmission.

                        The spinal cord is responsible for connecting the brain
                        to the nerves. The signals transmitted by the foot are
                        redirected to the brain through the spinal cord during a
                        foot injury.

                      will either sit and lean forward or lie flat on their side
                      with their knees close to their chest. The epidural
                      procedure includes the application of local anesthesia to
                      the area of the body where the epidural is going to be
                      administered. A pinching sensation may be experienced
                      during anesthesia.<br></br>
                      Following the numbing process, a spinal epidural will be
                      administered. It is possible that you will experience some
                      discomfort during the procedure of inserting the epidural
                      needle and catheter by your doctor.<br></br>
                      Others, however, do not experience any sensation at all.
                      After the injection, most of the pain disappears. Tell
                      your doctor as soon as possible if you experience intense
                      pain during or following the insertion of an epidural. You
                      will receive pain relief medication through a catheter.
                      Most people are able to complete the process in 20 to 30
                      minutes.

                    <p>
                      A six-month period may allow for the administration of
                      three injections. It is common for injections to be spaced
                      by two to three weeks. Typically, three injections are
                      provided. The first or second injection may, however,
                      provide considerable relief. It may not be necessary to
                      administer further injections in such a case.

                        An ESI treatment is an effective and safe method of
