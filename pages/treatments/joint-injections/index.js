                    <h2>Joint Injections</h2>
                    <p>
                      About 24% of the population in the United States suffers
                      from arthritis, which affects 58.5 million people.
                      Inflammation of joints caused by arthritis can lead to
                      joint pain. Joints are where two bones meet. Aside from
                      moving from side to side, up and down, and in rotation,
                      they can also move.To keep bones from rubbing against each
                      other, cartilage covers their ends to make them move
                      easily. The bones rub together when the cartilage wears
                      down, which causes significant pain during movement.
                      <br></br>
                      An injection of local anesthetic and steroids reduces
                      joint inflammation and pain.

                      are a great alternative to other treatments. It is
                      possible to reduce joint pain for a long period of time by
                      administering a joint injection. Injections for arthritis
                      can be beneficial for pain treatment, but what types are
                      available? In the following sections, we are able to
                      discuss in more detail what joint injections are, how they
                      work, and what they can do for you.

                      People with infections, pregnancy, bleeding problems, or

                      experience a slight rise in blood sugar levels. Glaucoma
                      patients may also experience temporary elevations in blood

                        Treatment may require repeated visits every few weeks or

                      <li>
                        Before receiving an injection, the problem area is
                        assessed to determine if an injection is appropriate for

                      <li>
                        An examination of the joint is part of determining
                        whether an injection is necessary to treat the problem.
                        In most cases, pre-injection ultrasound examinations are
                        necessary.

                        In order to determine if this is something that you wish
                        to pursue, you will receive information on the risks,

                        The doctor prepares injection medications, which are
                        usually steroid preparations and anesthetics or numbing
                        agents. The following ingredients may cause an allergic
                        reaction in certain people. Please inform your physician
                        if you experience an allergic reaction.

                        It will greatly reduce contamination risks by removing
                        bacteria from the skin around the injection site.

                        Then, with topical spray, the area is numb and cleaned

                        Moreover, there's a cooling/freezing effect to this

                        After that, you advance the needle into your target
                        area. It's sometimes necessary to use ultrasound
                        guidance to get into a very specific place inside the
                        joint.

                      <li>
                        Usually, fluid is aspirated first if there's a lot of
                        fluid buildup.

                      <li>
                        The procedure relieves pressure within the joint and can
                        also be sent for further evaluation if necessary.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Following the needle placement, appropriate medications
                        are delivered into the joint.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        We have completed the procedure and removed the needle.
                        The wound can be treated with a simple bandage. Within
                        48 hours of receiving the injection, it is recommended
                        that you refrain from excessive use of the affected
                        joint.
