                      . This procedure works by blocking the nerve supply to the
                      painful area, so it relieves pain and restores function.
                      <br></br>
                      There are numerous nerves that innervate the knee joint,
                      including the femoral, common peroneal, saphenous, tibial,
                      and obturator. The genicular nerves surround the knee
                      joint. A needle can easily reach several genicular nerves.
                      To see if genicular nerve blocks work, perform a test.
                      Anesthesia ("blocking") of these nerves is achieved with
                      the injection of local anesthetic through small needles.
                      Fluoroscopy is a method of guiding the needle into the
                      body by using live x-rays to ensure proper placement.Five
                      to ten minutes is all it takes.

                    <p>
                      Injection sites are found by identifying an injection
                      site, then advancing the needle tip in an in-plane or
                      out-of-plane direction until bony contact is felt.
                      <br></br>
                      By rotating the transducer in a transverse direction, the
                      needle tip can also be directed towards the bone surface.
                      When the LA is in the right position, we'll inject the

                    <h2>What To Expect From Your Procedure</h2>
                    <p>
                      It is recommended that you arrive 20 minutes before your
                      appointment on the day of the procedure. An IV will be
                      started if you request sedation. A physical examination
                      will also be conducted as part of the preoperative
                      assessment. We will take you to your procedure room
                      following your assessment and administer sedation to
                      ensure that you are comfortable during the procedure.{" "}
                      <br></br>
                      It is important to clean your skin thoroughly before the
                      procedure in order to reduce the risk of infection. Your
                      doctor will identify the procedure site under x-ray
                      guidance. Following the identification of the site, a
                      numbing medicine (typically bupivacaine) will be
                      administered to numb the area.<br></br>
                      You may feel a bit stung after receiving the shot.
                    </p>
                    <h2>After Your Procedure, Here Is What You Can Expect</h2>
                    <p>
                      Injection sites may experience minor swelling or pain
                      following nerve blocks. Additionally, the treatment should
                      significantly reduce knee pain. The pain usually begins to
                      subside within a few hours to a few days after the
                      procedure.<br></br>
                      In most cases, you will be able to reduce your pain with a
                      genicular nerve block to the point where you will no
                      longer require as much pain medication during the day.
                      Moreover, normal activities will be less painful for you.
                      <br></br>
                      The nerve block may result in a neurotomy or a
                      radiofrequency ablation if the nerve block is effective.{" "}
                      <br></br>
                      It is similar to a nerve block in the way that genicular
                      nerve neurotomy is performed. However, your doctor will
                      deaden the nerve with a special needle rather than numbing
                      and blocking it. A neurotomy can provide pain relief for
                      anywhere from six months to two years. <br></br>
