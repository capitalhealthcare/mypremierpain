                    <h1>Is Electrodiagnostic Testing Helpful?</h1>
                    <p>
                      The human body is likened to an electrical generator.
                      Nerves and muscles are responsible for delivering
                      electrical signals to and from your brain. A damaged nerve
                      or muscle can slow or prevent the transmission of
                      electrical signals. A measurement of the electrical
                      activity in your nerves and muscles can detect back, neck,
                      or limb pain, weakness, or numbness. An electrodiagnostic
                      test measures how quickly and strongly electrical impulses
                      travel through nerves and muscles.{" "}
                      <b>Electrodiagnostic</b> is an important tool for{" "}
                      <Link href="../../contact-locations/richardson/">
                        pain management in Richardson
                      </Link>{" "}
                      , Texas. A damaged nerve or muscle will transmit a weaker
                      and slower electrical signal.{" "}
                    </p>
                    <h2>Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS)</h2>
                    <p>
                      It is common to perform NCS as well as an EMG to determine
                      whether a nerve is functioning normally or not. During the
                      test, the doctor will apply wires (electrodes) along the
                      nerve pathway to the skin. An electric current is then
                      applied to the nerve by the doctor. Electrodes placed
                      along the nerve pathway capture the signal as it travels
                      along the pathway and measure its speed. Electrical
                      signals can travel as fast as 120 miles per hour in
                      healthy nerves. A damaged nerve, however, will result in a
                      slower and weaker signal. A doctor can determine the
                      specific location of the problem by stimulating the nerve
                      at various locations. In addition, nerve conduction
                      studies are useful in monitoring a nerve's recovery
                      following an injury.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Electromyography (EMG)</h2>
                    <p>
                      The EMG records and analyzes the electrical activity of
                      muscles. Consequently the purpose of this test is to learn
                      more about the functioning of the nerves connecting the
                      spinal cord to the muscles. When the muscle is at rest, it
                      is electrically silent. An EMG consists of placing small,
                      thin needles in selected muscles to record electrical
                      activity. You may experience pain and discomfort during
                      the needle insertion. The doctor will ask you to relax the
                      muscle and tense it slightly. The doctor will listen and
                      watch a TV-like screen that broadcasts electrical signals.
                      Additionally, you may also hear the sound when moving the
                      muscle. Electrodiagnostics may be used to evaluate
                      radiculopathies, carpal tunnel syndrome, myopathies and
                      peripheral neuropathies, just to name a few.

                        Notify the technician and physician if you are taking

                        (Mestinon), it should be held for 12 hours prior to
                        testing with your physician's consent.

                        Studies take 40 minutes to 1 ½ hours depending on the

                      Following testing, you can resume your normal daily

                      . On the day of your EMG, avoid lotions or oils. During
                      testing, it is advisable to layer your clothing to
                      facilitate removal. We will show you to the testing room
                      when you arrive at the clinic. Prior to the procedure,
                      please remove any jewelry or metal objects that may
                      interfere with the procedure or results. If your doctor
                      tests your muscles, they may ask you to sit or lay down.
                      There will be a sterile needle inserted into your muscle
                      and an electrode nearby. As a result of this electrode,
                      your doctor will be able to monitor your movements and
                      determine if there is an underlying condition. This is
                      based on the electrical signal. The needle may cause some
                      slight discomfort during insertion, and it may be
                      necessary to insert the needle multiple times. Please
                      inform your physician if the procedure becomes painful.
                      When the doctor relaxes and contracts the muscles, he
                      examines them. An EMG procedure can take 10 to 90 minutes,
                      depending on the muscle type.

                    <p>
                      Your referring physician will let you know when you can
                      expect your results once he or she receives the
                      electrodiagnostic test results. Following your procedure,
                      you may resume any normal activities. Occasionally, you
                      may experience soreness and tenderness following an

                    <p>
                      In a sterile, office-based environment, electrodiagnostics
                      can be safely performed. Depending on the symptoms and the
                      number of nerves and muscles to be tested, the tests can
                      last anywhere from 15 minutes to two hours. Patients who
                      wear lotion on the day of the test will have difficulty
                      collecting data.
