                    <p>
                      An intrathecal pump may be helpful if you are experiencing
                      chronic pain due to cancer or another illness. An

                        Intrathecal pump North Richland Hills
                      </Link>{" "}
                      is an implanted device for treating pain. In this method,
                      pain medication is delivered directly to the spinal cord.
                      <br></br>As compared to taking the same medication by
                      mouth, you will require considerably less medication to
                      control pain. This enhances the effectiveness of the
                      medication. In addition, fewer side effects are likely to
                      occur.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Intrathecal Drug Pumps: What Are They?</h2>
                    <p>
                      A fluid-filled space surrounds your spinal cord, known as
                      the subarachnoid or intrathecal space. CSF, which bathes
                      and protects the brain and spinal cord, flows through this
                      area. By delivering medicine directly into the CSF,
                      intrathecal drug pumps are more efficient than oral
                      medication since they bypass the path taken by oral
                      medications through the body. The amount of medication
                      needed with a pump is generally 1/300 that required when
                      taken orally (morphine or baclofen).
                    </p>
                    <h3>Who Is A Candidate?</h3>
                    <p>
                      The following criteria may determine whether you are
                      suitable for intrathecal drug delivery:

                      <li>Pain medication is a necessity for you</li>

                      may be considered in the case of chronic pain induced by
                      an injury or cancer pain caused by a disease or injury.
                      Pain management with this method may be beneficial when
                      other types of pain management have failed to provide
                      relief or have caused severe side effects.

                      before they are implanted to ensure they will work in your
                      case. This is known as a trial. It is possible that you
                      will receive an injection of pain medication.
                      Alternatively, an intrathecal pain pump may be tested for
                      a short period of time (temporary). In the course of this
                      procedure:
                    </p>
                    <ul className="bullt-list v1">
                      <li>
                        It is necessary for you to lie face down on a medical
                        table. Over your spine, there is a numbed area in your
                        back.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Then, the doctor may administer medications in order to
                        help you relax or fall asleep.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        A portion of the spine is incised by the healthcare
                        provider. In order to perform this procedure, a stiff
                        tube is inserted through the skin. There is an
                        intrathecal space surrounding the spinal cord.

                      <li>
                        It is necessary for the provider to insert a thin,
                        flexible tube (catheter) into the intrathecal space. In
                        order to determine whether the pain medication is
                        effective, the tube delivers it for a few days.

                      <li>
                        The pain relief trial will result in a pump implant.
                        This procedure results in:
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        A new catheter is inserted under the skin by the
                        physician.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        One inch of your lower abdomen (abdomen) is then placed
                        with the pump. An inch-thick, three-inch-wide disk is
                        the pump. A five- to seven-year battery powers it. Pump
                        connects to the catheter.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Then, the provider connects the pumps to small devices
                        outside of the body.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        In order to control the pump, the provider uses this
                        device.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        A healthcare provider may be able to program the pump.

                      <li>
                        Additionally, the amount can be set at a certain level.
                        It depends on your type of pain and other factors what
                        type of medication will be used in the pump.{" "}
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        It is necessary to refill the pump with medicine as
                        needed. It is possible for this to occur every one to
                        three months.

                    <p>
                      Based on the severity of the disease and the underlying

                      In addition to reducing pain, chronic pain sufferers may
                      also experience improvements in their activities of daily
                      living. You might see less rigidity and spasms if you
                      suffer from spasticity. Moreover, by directly reaching the
                      spinal cord and delivering the medicine in smaller doses,
                      it is easier for patients to take less medicine.
