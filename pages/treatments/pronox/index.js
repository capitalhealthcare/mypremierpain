                      The prospect of undergoing minimally invasive
                      interventional pain management procedures involving
                      needles may cause some patients to be reluctant or even
                      frozen with fear. Occasionally, patients simply want their
                      treatment to be comfortable. In addition to offering
                      patients relief from anxiety and improved comfort during

                      centers providers are now offering patients the
                      opportunity to discover the remarkable potential
                      interventional pain medicine holds to help reduce their
                      pain. Nitrous oxide is a fast-acting inhaled analgesic
                      (pain reliever) that is non-narcotic. In addition to
                      overcoming anxiety and reducing pain during non-surgical
                      procedures, it has been shown to be effective and
                      inexpensive.

                    <p>
                      Our practice uses Pro-Nox for a number of procedures,
                      including office surgery, vein treatment, and laser
                      therapy. In almost all cases in which the patient may
                      experience pain during the procedure, this treatment may
                      be beneficial According to studies,{" "}
                      <Link href="https://www.mypremierpain.com/contact-locations/richardson/">

                      </Link>{" "}
                      makes these procedures more comfortable. Most surgeries
                      use numbing products topically or injected, as well as
                      Valium and/or Vicodin<br></br>
                      The Pro-Nox procedure is much more comfortable for the
                      patient than traditional injections, with the provider not
                      having to stop in order to alleviate patient discomfort
                      during the procedure. Injection numbing is sometimes not
                      necessary, which may lead to additional downtime in the
                      event that bruising occurs.

                    <p>
                      During a dental procedure, PronoxTM is similar to oxygen
                      and nitrous oxide inhalation, which eases anxiety and
                      discomfort.<br></br>
                      As soon as PronoxTM is administered, it begins to work and
                      relieves the patient's anxiety and pain so that the
                      procedure will be as comfortable as possible.
