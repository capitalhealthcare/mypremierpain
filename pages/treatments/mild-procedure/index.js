                    <h2>Mild Procedure, Mild Surgery</h2>
                    <p>
                      There may be pain or cramping in your legs when you stand
                      for a long period of time when you have spinal stenosis
                      affecting the nerves in your lower back, called the lumbar
                      spine. You may also experience back pain when standing up
                      or walking. Bending forward or sitting usually alleviates
                      this discomfort. <br></br>There is a{" "}
                      <b>mild surgery, a mild procedure</b>&nbsp; that can lead
                      to a reduction in pain and an increase in standing and
                      walking distance for individuals with lumbar spinal
                      stenosis (LSS). No general anesthesia, implants, or
                      stitches are required for this short outpatient procedure.
                      As a result of participation in the study, participants
                      reported significant pain reduction and increased
                      mobility. The mild procedure also carries a very low risk
                      of major complications. Patients who don't respond to
                      these conservative treatments may qualify for mild, a
                      minimally invasive lumbar decompression treatment that is
                      guided by X-ray/fluoroscopic images.

                    <h2>Description Of Lumbar Spine Stenosis (LSS)</h2>
                    <p>
                      LSS causes nerve compression of your spinal cord in your
                      lower back due to a narrowing of your spinal canal. In
                      addition to thickening of ligaments, excessive bone
                      growth, and disc compression/bulging, our spine's natural
                      wear and tear can contribute to narrowing the spinal
                      canal.
                    </p>
                    <h3>LSS Symptoms</h3>
                    <p>
                      Your symptoms may be worse when you walk or stand, but
                      relieved when you sit or bend forward if you have a
                      certain type of LSS which can be treated by removing
                      excess tissue.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Why Is Mild So Beneficial?</h2>

                        When experiencing pain, numbness, or tingling in their

                      "pre-procedure testing" so that he can make sure that all
                      of your body systems are in good health and ready for the

                        If you feel comfortable driving after 3 days, you may do
                        so. When driving, it is critical to exercise your
                        judgment - if you are not in a stable condition, please
                        consult your physician first.

                        An outpatient procedure can be used to treat mild spinal
                        stenosis. The mild procedure for lumbar spinal stenosis
                        does not involve an implant or a large incision. Neither
                        steroids nor opioids are required.
