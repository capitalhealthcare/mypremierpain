                    <p>
                      In the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), clusters of neurons
                      carry sensory information into the spinal cord. Dorsal
                      roots of spinal nerves are locations where the nerves
                      branch away from the spine, where the ganglions reside.
                      Located in the feet, legs, and arms, the&nbsp;

                      typically responds to sensory stimuli (including pain). A
                      ganglion connects an organ, limb, or skin to the central
                      nervous system. Additionally, the dorsal root ganglion is
                      a type of ganglia in the peripheral nervous system. There
                      are nerves that originate in the dorsal root ganglion
                      (DRG) in the dorsal column (the back of the spinal cord).

                    <p>
                      A branch of the nerve then spreads throughout the body. An
                      effective method for managing chronic pain is to stimulate
                      the dorsal root ganglia, which relays signals from the
                      body to the brain. A pain management system consists of
                      electrodes and a pulse generator. There are contacts on
                      the electrical leads over the DRG near the spinal cord.
                      Although DRG stimulation is like spinal cord stimulation,
                      it targets painful areas differently than SCS. It is
                      possible to implant a pulse generator in our buttocks,
                      lower back, or abdominal wall. Using a handheld
                      controller, you are able to change the settings for the
                      stimulation.&nbsp;

                    <h2>
                      Conditions Treated with Dorsal Root Ganglion Stimulation
                    </h2>

                    <p>
                      The FDA approved the use of dorsal root ganglion
                      stimulation for the treatment of Complex Regional Pain
                      Syndrome (CRPS Type 1 and 2) in the lower extremities in
                      February 2016. Furthermore, spinal cord stimulation (SCS)
                      is similar to the procedure described above. Because this
                      type of stimulation targets a more precise location than
                      traditional SCS, it is more effective for smaller, more
                      localized areas of pain. Furthermore, it is particularly
                      effective in treating complex regional pain syndromes
                      (CRPS) and peripheral neuralgia. The premier pain
                      management centers offer a wide range of advanced
                      treatments. Basically, it&apos;s to relieve severe chronic
                      pain caused by diseases, surgeries, or injuries. A pain
                      medicine specialist may deliver electrical pulses to the
                      nervous system through dorsal root ganglion stimulation to
                      target pain in specific areas of the body.&nbsp;
                    </p>

                    <h2>Advantages of DRG Stimulation</h2>

                    <p>
                      In addition to being implanted under the skin, DRG
                      stimulators have several leads, which are placed in the
                      buttocks and abdomen. &nbsp;Both the pulse generator and
                      the tissue surrounding the target area are connected by
                      the leads. By pushing very small electrical impulses into
                      the dorsal root ganglion, the leads inhibit pain
                      stimulants&apos; transmission to the brain. One week of
                      trials is the first step toward ensuring the effectiveness
                      of treatment. As a pacemaker is implanted under the skin,
                      the device will be implanted into the patient&apos;s body
                      within a few days to a week. It generally takes 60 to 90
                      minutes to implant a bone.&nbsp;

                      stimulation allows selective stimulation of the area in
                      pain due to the highly targeted nature of the stimulation
                      field. Ninety-four percent of the patients in the ACCURATE

                      . Because of the narrow layer of tissue between the
                      stimulator and the dorsal root ganglion cells, DRG
                      stimulation only consumes approximately 10% of the energy
                      necessary for traditional SCS. This results in a longer
                      battery life.&nbsp;

                      of the time. Migration rates are reported by traditional
                      SCS at 14 percent.&nbsp;

                      . An MRI or fluoroscopy is used to insert small wires into
                      the spine. Wires in the back connect an implantable device
                      (similar to a pacemaker). After the wires and device are
                      in place, an electric pulse can be transmitted to the
                      brain with the assistance of a remote control that
                      interrupts pain messages traveling from the peripheral
                      nerves. Several studies have shown that electrical pulses
                      may reduce pain within a particular body region by causing
                      overactive neurons to return to a more settled state.
                      Moreover, it is possible to conduct a trial prior to the
                      surgical installation of the wires and device in order to
                      determine the patient&apos;s response to the
