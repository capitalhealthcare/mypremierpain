                    <h2>Regenerating Spinal Discs Treatment</h2>
                    <p>
                      Most people develop degenerated discs as they age, and
                      degenerative disc disease is not really a disease. There
                      is often pain and numbness associated with disc leaks. A
                      leak does not result in symptoms if there is no leak. An
                      annular tear is the cause of almost all degenerative
                      discs. In time, the tear progresses to multiple disc
                      tears, which eventually results in degenerative disc
                      disease. Degenerative disc disease is common in people
                      over 60, according to MRI and CT studies.<br></br>
                      Spinal conditions, such as degenerative disc disease, are
                      increasingly treated with biologics, such as stem cells
                      and plateletsâ€“rich plasma. There have been several
                      treatment tools available over the years for degenerative
                      disc disease, the leading cause of{" "}

                      . These conservative nonsurgical interventions often
                      relieve symptoms effectively. Lumbar fusion surgery is
                      sometimes necessary when conventional methods aren't

                      Degenerative disc disease is usually characterized by low

                    <p>
                      This condition is due to natural causes associated with
                      aging. Although the severity and nature of the condition
                      vary, many individuals do not experience any symptoms at
                      all. It is possible to consider several factors to play a

                    <p>
                      DRT has been reported to reduce pain and improve activity
                      level in multiple clinical trials. According to some
                      theories, the reduction in pain and disability is a result
                      of beneficial changes in the intervertebral disc.<br></br>
                      Research is increasing the use of DRT in discogenic pain
                      treatment plans across the globe. Due to its positive
                      results, this technique continues to gain popularity.
                      Additionally, the procedure may reduce the need for more
                      expensive surgeries.
