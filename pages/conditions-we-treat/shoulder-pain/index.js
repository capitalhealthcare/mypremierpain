                    <h2>Possible Causes Behind Shoulder Pain</h2>
                    <p>
                      The shoulder is actually a collection of joints, tendons,
                      and muscles that allow your arm to move in a variety of
                      ways - from scratching your back to throwing the perfect
                      pitch. The cost of mobility, however, is high.
                      Consequently, you may experience pain or instability in
                      your shoulder due to impingement or instability of soft
                      tissues or bony structures. Your shoulder may be painful
                      only when you move it, or it may be painful all the time.
                      Symptoms of pain can range from temporary to persistent,
                      and may require medical treatment and diagnosis.

                      <li>
                        <b>Dislocation &ndash; </b>When you pull back your
                        shoulder too hard or rotate too far, your arm may pop
                        out. Your shoulder will be painful and weak. Bruising,
                        swelling, and numbness are also common symptoms.

                        <b>Separation &ndash;</b>A shoulder blade injury occurs
                        when the collarbone meets the shoulder blade.
                        Acromioclavicular (AC) is the name of this joint.
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            A fall or hard blow may cause the ligaments holding
                            the joint together to tear. A bump will appear on
                            the top of your shoulder if your collarbone is out
                            of place.

                          <li>
                            Fracture. Falling or taking a hard blow can cause a
                            bone to break or crack. Broken clavicles and
                            humeruses (bones closest to the shoulder) are most
                            often the result of an accident. Bruises and pain
                            will be experienced as a result. It may be
                            impossible for you to lift your arm.
                          </li>

                      <li>
                        <b>Cartilage Tear &ndash; </b>A shoulder injury can
                        result from an injury to the cartilage (the rubbery
                        padding that surrounds the joint rim). Performing the
                        same motion repeatedly may result in this condition. If
                        you fall or your shoulder absorbs a significant amount
                        of force, you may also damage it. Symptoms of this type
                        of injury may include pain when reaching over your head
                        and a weak shoulder. Furthermore, it may feel as if it
                        is locking, catching, or grinding.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Rotator Cuff Tear &ndash; </b>Consequently, your
                        joint has a limited range of motion due to this
                        condition. An abnormal tissue growth (adhesions) within
                        the shoulder joint prevents your shoulder from moving
                        freely. As a result of pain or surgery, you may not use
                        your shoulder as much, allowing adhesions to form.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Frozen Shoulder &ndash; </b> &ndash; This is a muscle
                        tear or muscle tension in the back thigh. Symptoms may
                        include biceps femoris, semimembranosus, or
                        semitendinosus.

                      <li>
                        <b>Impingement &ndash; </b> As a result of pinched
                        rotator cuff tendons in the shoulder bones, this
                        condition develops. Swelling and pain may result from
                        this condition. Lifting your arms over your head
                        frequently may cause this problem.

                        <b>Bursitis &ndash; </b>Repeatedly repeating the same
                        movements can result in swollen and inflamed bursae (a
                        fluid-filled sac that cushions your joints). A fall or
                        another injury may also result in this condition. Your
                        shoulder may be most painful when you move it if you
                        have bursitis.

                        affected. A breakdown of cartilage causes the bones to

                        should not be treated with medication on a long-term
                        basis. Your physician should be consulted if you
                        experience persistent pain. The doctor may recommend a
                        corticosteroid injection if the pain persists.

                      Although all medications have side effects, most people
                      are able to tolerate an injection to reduce their pain
                      while they recover. A repeat injection may be necessary
                      depending on your circumstances. Keep a pain diary to
                      monitor the effectiveness of your treatment. Depending on
                      the results, you can determine if other treatments are
                      necessary. Frozen shoulders may benefit from
                      hydrodilation. This procedure involves injecting fluid
                      (saline and steroids) into the joint.There is evidence
                      from a number of studies that this treatment reduces
                      symptoms and improves range of motion. As a follow-up to
                      treatment, physiotherapy can provide further improvements.

                      quickly as possible. Your nerves will usually heal and all
                      symptoms will be relieved in most cases. Do not stop
                      physical therapy or other treatments if you no longer
                      experience symptoms. A numb shoulder will not occur again
                      as a result of this procedure. Be aware of your symptoms
                      and do not ignore them. You should see a doctor if you
                      experience numbness in your shoulder, arm, hand, neck,
                      upper back, or shoulder blade.
