                      parts of your body where your bones meet. We should also
                      know that these joints allow the bones of your skeletal
                      system to move. Joints include; Shoulders, Hips, Elbows,
                      and Knees. Sometimes, joint pain is the result of an
                      illness or injury. Arthritis is also a common cause of
                      joint pain. However, it may also be due to other
                      circumstances or factors. Whereas we at&nbsp;

                    <h2>What Are The Common Ways Of Pain Management?</h2>
                    <p>
                      In order of prevalence, the following are the methods most
                      often recommended for managing joint pain:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <p>
                          Anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly
                          recommended for the treatment of joint pain. Pain and
                          inflammation can be treated using nonsteroidal
                          anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs). A few examples
                          are the pain relievers ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB,
                          and others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). Taking a
                          stronger NSAID may increase your risk of heart attack
                          or stroke, as well as irritate your stomach. You can
                          also get nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
                          in the form of topical creams or gels to put on your
                          aching muscles and joints.
                        </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>
                          Counterirritants. Capsaicin, the compound responsible
                          for the spicy flavor of peppers, can be found in some
                          topical lotions and ointments. Applying these remedies
                          topically to the skin over the sore joint may prevent
                          pain signals from reaching the brain.
                        </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>
                          Steroids. Prednisone and other corticosteroid drugs
                          are used to lessen the severity of joint injury and
                          inflammation. Corticosteroids can be either orally or
                          injected directly into the achy joint. Potential
                          adverse consequences include bone loss, increased body
                          fat, and perhaps diabetes. However, this method is
                          strongly prescribed by our team at&nbsp;

                          DMDs, or disease-modifying antirheumatic medications
                          (DMARDs). By halting the progression of RA, these
                          medications can prevent irreversible damage to the
                          joints and other tissues. Conventional DMARDs
                          aren&apos;t the only option; biological medicines and
                          tailored synthetic DMARDs are also available. Most
                          DMARDs raise your risk of infections, but this is not
                          always the case.

                    <p>
                      Capturing techniques may give your healthcare provider a
                      clear picture of what is happening to your members.
                      Photographic methods may include the following:

                          X-ray. X-rays may show joint changes and bone injuries
                          found in other forms of arthritis. Further image
                          testing can be done.

                          Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses sound waves to detect the
                          quality of synovial tissue, muscles, ligaments, and
                          bones.

                          Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI images are more
                          detailed than X-rays. Also, They may show joint
                          damage, including muscle, ligaments, and cartilage.

                          Arthroscopy. This procedure uses a tiny tube
                          containing light and a camera (arthroscope) to view
                          the joint. The arthroscope is inserted into the joint
                          with a small incision. Inner member photos are
                          displayed on the screen. Used to test for any
                          degenerative and/or arthritic changes in the joint;
                          diagnose orthopedic diseases; determine the cause of
                          bone pain and inflammation, and treat certain
                          conditions.

                          general population (usually occurring in the fingers
                          and wrists).

                          Bursitis is caused by overuse. The hip, knee, elbow,
                          and shoulder are all affected.

                          Tendinitis is inflammation or irritation of the
                          tendons, the tough bands of tissue that connect bones
                          and muscles. This condition typically shows up in the
                          elbow, the heel, and the shoulder due to overuse.
