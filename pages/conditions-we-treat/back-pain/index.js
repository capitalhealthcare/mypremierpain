                    <p>
                      Testing for a diagnosis is typically only called for if
                      the discomfort has persisted for more than two weeks. It
                      is also necessary to rule out underlying reasons such as
                      undiscovered spinal disc damage if the pain extends into
                      the extremities or around the chest well beyond the spinal
                      epicenter of the pain concentration. Your doctor may
                      recommend the following procedures if your symptoms do not
                      improve. However, our team at &nbsp;
