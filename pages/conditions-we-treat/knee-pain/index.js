                      <li>
                        <b>Leg cramps &ndash; </b>Cramps occur when muscles
                        become tight. When muscles are overworked, you may
                        experience muscle tension.

                        which a fluid pocket grows in the back of the knee,
                        leading to pain and swelling.

                        <b>Osteoarthritis &ndash; </b>This damages and causes
                        inflammation in the joint cartilage. You may feel pain
                        in the backside of the knee, which hinders movement and
                        bending.

                        condition in which the cartilage in the knee joints

                        together, causing friction.

                        while bending or crouching, this cartilage can be
                        damaged. This may lead to limited function in the knees.

                        accident and your ligaments are torn, you are likely to
                        develop a PCL injury. The injury is most often
                        identified by knee pain.

                    <p>
                      The knee, together with the ankles and the hips, is
                      responsible for supporting the body&apos;s weight as you
                      bend and straighten it. Also, The knee, though, is more
                      than just a hinged joint; it also twists and rotates. And
                      the knee uses its bones, ligaments, tendons, and cartilage
                      to carry out all of these functions and support the whole
                      body.
